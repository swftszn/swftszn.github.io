  <p3>Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, 
  motion graphics, and compositing application 
  developed by Adobe Systems and used in the post-production 
  process of film making, video games and television production. 
  Among other things, After Effects can be used for keying,
  tracking, compositing, and animation. It also functions 
  as a very basic non-linear editor, audio editor, and media 
  transcoder. In 2019, the program won an Academy Award for 
  scientific and technical achievement. </p3>
